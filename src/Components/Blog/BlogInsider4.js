                    <p>You see a pattern emerging / Everyone who has 'experimented' with
                        replacing their computer with an iPad full-time is just swapping out
                        mashing away on one keyboard for another. in other words they could
                        have swapped their MaxBook for a speak 'n' Spell and not noticed any
                        difference.</p>

                    <p>All the same time is the ridicule in the comments. The iPad isn't a
                        proper computer. You can't do 'real work' on a tablet.Why didn't you
                        just buy an M1 MacBook Air? Why didn't you build yourown PC?</p>
